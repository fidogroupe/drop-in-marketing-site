    <h1>It All Started With&nbsp;Hockey</h1>
    <p>
      Our founder, Jesse, started Drop In when he was tired of struggling to get enough players for he and his buddies' pick-up hockey games. He had the pond, the lights...the rink was set but there never seemed to be an easy way to let others know the game was happening. He would resort to several methods but they never really&nbsp;worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Drop In, Jesse sets up a pick-up game and people are able to get alerted before he even sets his stick on the ice. No messy text message trains. No sifting through Facebook. Just the sound of the puck in the back of the net and sweet sweet&nbsp;victory.

    <h1>Motivation For The&nbsp;Run</h1>
    <p>
      Finding the motivation to run costs Peter, one of our developers, hundreds of dollars with every new gadget he pre-orders. With Drop In, though, he found the greatest motivator of all was good 'ol fashioned embarrassment when others are counting on him and he didn't show&nbsp;up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter can now skip the latest BitFit or GPS with hyper-glonass-satellite-ultra and just have a few buddies run with him. That gets him up and lacing his kicks faster than the to-the-second heart rate in full color on his wrist. <i>Although he still can't help but pre-order anything that's shiny and from fruit&nbsp;companies.</i>

    <h1>Basketball Pick-Up&nbsp;Games</h1>
    <p>
      Our head of business development, Michael, travels a lot and is always looking for a good pick-up game of basketball. On a recent trip to Portland he was looking for a quick game of basketball after a meeting. He knew Brian played near his meeting...but he couldn't remember what "Brian no-last-name" in his phone was the basketball player in Portland or his&nbsp;dentist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael can now use Drop In to know whether or not Brian no-last-name is playing hoops or just spot another pick-up game getting going several blocks away. <i>Hey...is that his dentist with that awesome&nbsp;layup?</i>
