  <h1>Sports Highlights</h1>
  <div class="sports-highlight--hockey">
    <h1>It All Started With&nbsp;Hockey</h1>
    <p>
      Drop In's founder, Jesse, started Drop In when he struggled to get enough players for he and his buddies' pick-up hockey games. They had the pond, the lights...the rink was set but there never seemed to be an easy way to let others know the game was&nbsp;happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Drop In, Jesse sets up a pick-up game and people are able to get alerted before he even sets his stick on the ice. No messy text message trains. No sifting through Facebook. No&nbsp;worry.
    </p>

  <div class="sports-highlight--running">
    <h1>Motivation For The&nbsp;Run</h1>
    <p>
      Finding the motivation to run costs Peter, one of our developers, hundreds of dollars with every new gadget. He found the greatest motivator of all was good 'ol fashioned embarrassment when others are counting on him and he doesn't show&nbsp;up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Drop In, Peter can skip the latest BitFit or GPS with hyper-glonass-satellite-ultra and just have a few buddies run with him. That gets him up and lacing his kicks faster than the to-the-second heart rate in full color on his wrist. <i>He actually still love those watches, though. Anything techie for&nbsp;him.</i>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="sports-highlight--basketball">
    <h1>Basketball Pick-Up&nbsp;Games</h1>
    <p>
      Our head of business development, Michael, travels a lot and is always looking for a good pick-up game of basketball. He had a few connections but can't remember what "Brian no-last-name" in his phone was the basketball player in Portland he met or his&nbsp;dentist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael can use Drop In to know whether or not Brian no-last-name is playing hoops or just spot another pick-up game getting going several blocks away from his last meeting of the day. <i>Hey...is that his dentist with that awesome&nbsp;layup?</i>
